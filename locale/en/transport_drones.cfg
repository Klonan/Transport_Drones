welcome-1=Welcome to Transport Drones!\nTransport drones is a mod which introduces a new method of moving materials around your Factory.
fuel-depot-1=All transportation within the road network requires fuel. Fuel is delivered by [font=default-bold]Fuel Depots[/font].\n\nThe operation is simple:\n - Place a fuel depot on the road network.\n - Plumb in the fuel.\n - Add transport drones.\n\nNow the fuel depot will dispatch transport drones to fuel depots in the road network.
drones-1=The [font=default-bold]Transport drones[/font] are the agents that transport material between depots. They are only ever assigned to a single depot. To work they require fuel, and they produce pollution as they drive around.
drone-details=Current drone specifications are as follows:\n - Fuel consumption: [font=default-bold]__1__[/font] per kilometer.\n - Pollution: [font=default-bold]__2__[/font] per minute.\n - Drone item capacity: [font=default-bold]__3__[/font] stacks.\n - Drone fluid capacity: [font=default-bold]__4__[/font].\n - Max drone speed: [font=default-bold]__5__[/font] km/h.
request-depot-1=To move items in in the road network, you use [font=default-bold]Request Depots[/font]. These will dispatch drones to the nearest supply depot with the requested item.\nThe number of items the request depot will collect is dependant on the number of drones in the request depot. For each drone, the request depot will increase its requested amount by the capacity of the drone.\n\n    Example 1: If the drones can hold 1 stack (no upgrades), and you put in 5 drones, the request depot will dispatch drones until it has 5 stacks in its inventory.\n    Example 2: If the drones can hold 2 stacks (1 capacity upgrade), and you put in 10 drones, the request depot will dispatch drones until it has 20 stacks in its inventory.\n\nIn this way, you can adjust and tune the requested amount, to take into account factors such as the required throughput, the distance between the request and supply depots, etc. The request count can be overridden using Transport depot writers.\nThe setup of a request depot is simple:\n - Place the request depot on the road network.\n - Select the item to request.\n - Insert transport drones.\nThe request depot will first request fuel from the network. Once it has fuel, it will begin to dispatch drones to collect the requested item.
supply-depot=[font=default-bold]Supply depots[/font] (and fluid depots) are passive participants in the road network. They make their content available to the request depots in the road network.
road-network=The [font=default-bold]Road network[/font] is the system in which the depots are connected to each other, and the road over which the transport drones operate. Building the road network is done simply using the road tiles. Any connected road tiles are part of the same road network. Two disconnected areas of road tiles are separate road networks, and their depots will not supply each other.
buffer-depot=The [font=default-bold]Buffer depot[/font] acts as both a request depot and a supply depot.\n\nA good use case is for collecting ores from far away outposts, for distribution to many nearby request depots.The buffer depot can have a large number of drones, and the nearby request depots only need a 1 or 2 drones to handle the short trip from the requester to the buffer.
circuit-connectors=The Circuit connectors are the way of reading and writing signals to the depots and road network. They allow using logistic conditions and circuit network logic to control the behavior of the depots.
depot-reader=The [font=default-bold]Transport depot reader[/font] allows you to read the contents of the request depots, fuel depots, mining depots, fluid depots and buffer depots.\n\nThe output is only ever 1 signal, which is the content of the output inventory.
depot-writer=The [font=default-bold]Transport depot writer[/font] allows you to enable and disable the depots based on circuit/logistic conditions.\n    Example 1: Disabling a request depot will stop it sending drones to collect items.\n    Example 2: Disabling a supply depot will stop it from making its items available to the road network.
depot-writer-special=There is a special case for request/buffer depots. If the circuit signal is the requested item and the condition is '=', the request depot will use the signal count as a item request count.\n    Example: If the signal is set to 'Iron gear = 155', then the request depot will try to fill up to 155 items, regardless of drone count.\n\nThis also works using a circuit signal.\n    Example: If the signal is set to 'Iron gear = Signal Green', then it will evaluate the value of 'Signal Green' and that will be the item request count.
transport-depots=Transport depots are the entities in the road network which co-ordinate the transportation of items and fluids. They manage the content and requests of the road networks. They connect to the road network via the 'caution' plate on the ground, and this position is where the drones will be dispatched to and from.
mining-depots=[font=default-bold]Mining depots[/font] can also provide their contents directly to the road network. Simply connect the miner input/output position to the road network.
network-reader=The [font=default-bold]Road network reader[/font] can read the content of the Road network that it is attached to. However you must specify which signal to read, by opening the reader and choosing the item/fluid you want to read the content of. Once selected the Road network reader will continue to update the count of that item with the content of the road network.\n\nThis lets you for instance, enable or disable certain production lines if the amount of ore in the road network falls below a certain value, or enable a reserve storage.
